            <h1>about me!</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Ashlyn, and I'm a first year at the University of
                Waterloo studying Computer Science. I've always been passionate
                about learning new things, and love finding new projects to take on.
                Throughout high school and my time at Waterloo, I found myself drawn
                towards mathematics, design, and learning more about technology.
                <br><br>
                Besides balancing academics and extra-curricular activities,
                I've been working on what I think are some pretty interesting projects,
                so feel free to check them out! I'm currently working on
                designing new plugins for Minecraft Java Edition to use with my
                friends.
                <br><br>
                Other than programming and designing, I also really love video games,
                drawing, and photo/video editing!
                Here are a few fun facts about me in case you're interested :)
                <br><br>
                • I used to have a video editing account with over 1000 followers
                <br>
                • I've been apart of a coding team that programmed a robot!
                <br>
                • I'm left handed (I think this makes me pretty special)
